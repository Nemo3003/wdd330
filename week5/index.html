    <h1>Week 05 - WDD330</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <p>I love how this chapter begins. It is so true that bugs and errors are always present in software development</p><br>
    <p>It is not possible to have a program that does not have any bug at all <br>
    As a programmer we have to take care of programming errors as well as ensuring that if the user does something we <br>
did not expect them to do, that has to be covered. <br>
An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error
I have never seen the usage of stack trace, but it seems useful to see where the error is <br>
Warnings are just to tell us if something is not right, but it is not an error.<br>
As programmers we have to ensure that our code has a good quality and that we do not have any bugs in it. Or at least that it does not have tons of them <br>
<br>Strict mode is my favorite thing to use in JavaScript. It is a way to make sure that we do not have any poor practice or a "lazy" code <br>
   So for example, if you write a variable this way: name = "John";, if you are using strict mode this will throw an error but if you are not using it, then JS will be just fine with it. <br>
   Linting tools are also a good alternative, they are quite unforgiving so if you use them, beware that they will highlight any poor practice or syntax error. Which is not a bad thing, though <br>
   Feature detection is used to ensure that a determined browser supports a certain feature. <br>
   <h3>Debugging in the browser</h3><br>
   You can use the alert popup to see what is going on in the browser. <br>
    You can use the console to see what is going on in the browser as well as seeing any error or warning. This includes the console.log() <br>
    Debugging tools: Most browsers nowadays include debugging tools, such as Google Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox <br>
    I love the debugger keyword, it is very useful to see what is your program up to. <br>
    You can even create your own error using a constructor: const error = new Error("This is an error"); <br>
    There are many errors: <ul>
        <li>EvalError</li>
        <li>RangeError</li>
        <li>ReferenceError</li>
        <li>SyntaxError</li>
        <li>TypeError</li>
        <li>URIError</li>
    </ul> <br>
    To throw errors you can use the throw keyword. <br>
    This is an example of the usage of the throw keyword: <br>
    <pre>
    function throwError() {
        throw new Error("This is an error");
    }
    </pre>

    <pre>
        function squareRoot(number) {
            'use strict';
            if (number < 0) {
            throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of
             negative numbers')
            }
            return Math.sqrt(number);
            };
    </pre>
    <br>
    To handle these errors we have to use try and catch blocks. <br>
    <pre>
        try {
            squareRoot(-1);
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error.message);
        }
    </pre>
    <br>
    A finally block is always executed, even if an error is thrown. <br>
    <pre>
        try {
            squareRoot(-1);
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error.message);
        } finally {
            console.log("This is always executed");
        }
    </pre>
    <br>
    <h3>Tests</h3>
    Tests are a great way to ensure that your code is working as expected. <br>
    Usage of tests can be as follows:
    <pre>function itSquareRoots4() {
        return squareRoot(4) === 2;
        }</pre>
    <h3>Test driven development</h3><br>
    It's the process of writing tests before any code is written. <br>
    After the code passes that test, it is refactored to be more efficient <br>
    Its workflow is as follows: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Write a test</li>
        <li>Write the code that passes the test</li>
        <li>Write a test that fails</li>
        <li>Write the code that fails the test</li>
        <li>Write a test that passes</li>
        <li>Write the code that passes the test</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Testing frameworks</h3><br>
    There are many different frameworks that can be used to test your code. <br>
    They are: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Jasmine</li>
        <li>Mocha</li>
        <li>Chai</li>
        <li>Sinon</li>
        <li>Jest</li>
        <li>Karma</li>
    </ul>
