    <h1>Week 01: Notes</h1>
    <h2>Doing Stuff with web things & Github</h2>
    <p>Github desktop is an interesting tool to use, but I personally rather using the console <br>
    LocalStorage was interesting, I had already use it in the past but this time it really clicked, so I can say that now I understand how localStorage works <br>
    Everything else felt like a review
    </p>
    <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
    <p>
        I loved watching this! I am always surprised whenever I download an app and the design and its usability is simple <br>
        I am also impressed by the simplicity of the app, I am not sure if it is the best UX but I am impressed <br>
        Nowadays desktop computers sales are declining, many more people are using mobile devices <br>
        This makes me wonder if I should be focusing on mobile UX <br>
        Mobile first is becoming (if it is not already) a must, even a default requirement for web developers <br>
        Should we design first for mobile devices or first for desktop? This has been in my mind for quite a long time <br>
