    <h2>Chapter 8 - CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <h3>Transforms</h3>
    <p>
        The transform property is quite nice to use! it allows you to translate, rotate, scale, and many other things!<br> That is why I love CSS3, we have way more control over what we do on the page.<br>
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/">Translate Property</a><br>
    </p>
    <h4>Translation</h4>
    <p>
        These functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. They behave similar to position: relative; <br> So, you have the translate(x,y), in which X represents the horizontal movement and the vertical movement is managed by the Y <br> Example: transform: translate(45px, -45px);<br>Or you can just use "transform: translateX(45px);"<br> Or transform: translateY(-30px);<br>Something else to keep in mind is that transforms do not work on inline elements.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Scaling</h4>
    <p>
        I honestly never used the scale(x,y) function. So! scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) makes it double <br>scale(0.5) would halve them and so on <br>
        An example would be: transform: scale(1.5, 0.25)<br>
        And of course, you can also use scaleX(x) or scaleY(y)<br>Something else scaling, as well as translation has no import on the document flow<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Rotation</h4>
    <p>
        The rotate() function rotates an element around a certain point<br>So an example could be: transform: rotate(10deg). As you can see, rotate() uses degrees. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Skew</h4>
    <p>
        The last transform function is the skew(x,y) function. <br> An example would be: transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);<br> Quite useful to modify how we see a text.<br> 
    </p>
     <h5>Changing the Origin of the Transform</h5>
    <p>
        It is possible to control the origin from which our transform is applied. This can be done using the transform-origin property. <br> An example could be made using: transform-origin: 10% 10%; or transform-origin
    </p>
    <br> 
    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <p>
        CSS transitions look smoother than making transitions with JavaScript, especially in mobile devices<br> 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>transition</li>
        <pre>div {
  transition: width 2s, height 4s;
}</pre>
        <li>transition-delay</li>
        <pre>
            div {
  transition-delay: 1s;
}
        </pre>
        <li>transition-duration</li>
        <pre>div{
             transition-duration: 2s;
        }
        </pre>
        <li>transition-property</li>
        <pre>
            div {
  transition-property: width;}
        </pre>
        <li>transition-timing-function</li>
        <pre>
            #div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;}
            #div2 {transition-timing-function: ease;}
            #div3 {transition-timing-function: ease-in;}
            #div4 {transition-timing-function: ease-out;}
            #div5 {transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;}
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <p>The <b>transition</b> property is a shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property
        <br><br>
        The <b>transition-delay</b> property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
        <br><br>
        The <b>transition-duration</b> property specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete <br><br>
        The <b>transition-property</b> specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for<br><br>
        The <b>transition-timing-function</b> property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.<br> 

This property can have the following values:<br> 

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)<br> 
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end<br> 
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start<br> 
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end<br> 
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end<br> 
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function<br> 
    </p>
      <h3>Animations</h3>
    <p>
        Animations unlike transitions allow you to control each step of an animation. <br>This is preferable when working with mobile.
    </p>
    <h4>Keyframes</h4>
    <p>
        To control each step of an animation, you need to use keyframes. <br> This is an example: <pre>
            @keyframes moveRight { 
             from {
                transform: translateX(-50%);
            }
            to {
                transform: translateX(50%);
            }
            }
            
            @keyframes appearDisappear { 
                 0%, 100% {
                opacity: 0;
            }
                20%, 80% {
                opacity: 1;
            }
            }

            @keyframes bgMove {
                100% {
                background-position: 120% 0;
            }
            }
        </pre>
        The rest I do not find it necessary, I have never used them and also, something we must remember is that <br> CSS animations are great but we must be careful to not abuse of them. <br> Animations and this stuff (like the marquee tag) where popular in the 90's, nowadays those animations look...not that good anymore. <br>
