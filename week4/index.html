    <h1>Week 04 - WDD330</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 08: Forms</h2>
    <p>It is interesting how much of what used to be done in the backend with php or ruby is now being processed with Javascript</p><br>
    <p>I love how nowadays we are focusing more on usability and also accessibility in order to deliver a product that can be used by anyone</p><br>
    <p>This is all a review to me, but the fact that you can use document.forms to get some information about forms in the page is interesting, but I do not find it relevant</p><br>
    <p>Methods: the form.submit() will do that, submit the form automatically. The form.reset() would reset the entire form. But be careful, reset() buttons are considered poor usability <br>
    form.action can be used to set a specific action, for example: form.action = '/an/other.url'</p>
