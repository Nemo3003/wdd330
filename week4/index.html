    <h1>Week 04 - WDD330</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 08: Forms</h2>
    <p>It is interesting how much of what used to be done in the backend with php or ruby is now being processed with Javascript</p><br>
    <p>I love how nowadays we are focusing more on usability and also accessibility in order to deliver a product that can be used by anyone</p><br>
    <p>This is all a review to me, but the fact that you can use document.forms to get some information about forms in the page is interesting, but I do not find it relevant</p><br>
    <p>Methods: the form.submit() will do that, submit the form automatically. The form.reset() would reset the entire form. But be careful, reset() buttons are considered poor usability <br>
    form.action can be used to set a specific action, for example: form.action = '/an/other.url'</p><br>
    <p>Form Events: are quite interesting, you have the focus, blur, and change events. The only one I did not know about was the change form which is fired when an input or a field has been changed or modified by the user: Example: input.AddEventListener('change', ()=>alert('changed'), false);</p> <br>
    <p>Submitting a Form: the most used event here is the submit event, this sends the form to the server for its processing</p><br>
    <p>Form controllers: I already knew about them and it is all just a review to me</p><br>
    <p>This is more HTML than JavaScript so I could say that I already know about this subject</p><br>
