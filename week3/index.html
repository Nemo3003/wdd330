    <h1>WDD330 - W03 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Object Method: this</h2>
    <p>As I understood, the "this" object will point to the current object</p><br>
    <p>This would allow us to call a certain property from the object. So, if the object is "Person" and you say "this.name"</p><br>
    <p>You refer to the object "Person" and to its property "name" therefore if the name was "John Doe" you will have "John Doe" as a result.</p>
    <p>It can also used in a function, so it is not necessary to have it inside a class</p> <br>
    <p>What is interesting to me is that arrow functions do not have "this".</p><br>
    <h2>Chapter 5: objects</h2>
    <p>Arrays and functions are built-in objects</p><br>
    <p>Objects are interesting, even though this lesson is a review to me, it is nice to put my hands on exercises</p><br>
    <p>I have been using JSON for quite a long time now, I enjoy doing so</p>
    <p>Stringify is quite useful, it basically takes an object and returns it as a JSON </p><br>
    <p>The math object has being a poweful ally when facing maths. I have used this object in Python, C#, Javascript, and Java</p><br>
    <p>RegExp, it is interesting to me because I knew about it and what it is used for, but last semester I preferred to use something similar but in HTML</p><br>
    <p>So yeah, it is all a review right now, and I cannot find much to comment about</p><br>
