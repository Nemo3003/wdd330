    <h1>MDN: Validating forms</h1>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation">Form Validation</a>
    <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
    <p>Before sending any information to the server or even to the Database, we need to make sure that the data we are sending <br> is correct and does not contain any format not allowed.  <br> The client-side validation is an initial validation.
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3>What is form validation?</h3>
    <p>Form validation is what you find whenever you try to log in in almost any site or when we try to register for a specific site. <br> Some of the reasons of why we want to have form validations are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We want to get the right data</li>
        <li>We want to protect our users' data</li>
        <li>We want to protect ourselves from malicious users</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Different types of client-side validation</h3>
    <p>There are two types of client-side validations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built-in form validation, done through HTML5</li>
        <li>Javascript, done through Javascript</li>
    </ul>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
