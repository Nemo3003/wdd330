   <h1>Week 02: Notes</h1>
   <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
   <h2>Chapter 2: Programming basics</h2>
   <p>Most of it felt just like a review. I loved reviewing this part of Javascript but I do not feel like it was necessary <br>
       <br>
       What was interesting is knowing more about the world "var" I never understood why it remained in the language, but now I know why <br>
       I loved learning that this happened because Javascript is always attempting to remain compatible to previous versions <br> <br>
       <i> "A ninja programmer will try to keep thenumber of global variables to a minimum,"</i> That made me laugh <br> <br>
       "If let or const are not used, the variable will have global scope and be available outside the block" That is some new information <br>
       I did not know that that is how you declare a global variable... I always use the "use strict" to avoid falling into some issues <br>
       So the fact that this is what a global scope is, is just mindblowing <br> <br>
       The fact that a variable can begin with a dollar sign or an underscore makes me wonder "do I really know JavaScript at all"? <br>
    <br> I wonder, are the bitwise operators being used at all? I have not seen anyone using them. Maybe my question should be "When and why should I use them?" <br>
    <br></p>
    <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, logics, and loops</h2>
    <p>
        I found interesting that whenever an array was declared, it was declared with the const word. e.g: const myArray = []
        <br>
        Everything about arrays felt just like a review. It is so nice to see that I understand and use each one of those methods <br>
        I never understood why someone would want to use multidimensional arrays...when should we use it? <br>
        The spread operator...I did not know that it could be used with multidimensional arrays. <br>
        Sets are to me kind of a mixture between lists and arrays. Even though they are different. Again, it feels like a review. <br>
        MAPS: Maps have always fascinated me. I found it interesting to see how maps are quite similar to arrays! <br>
        The spread operator can convert almost anything to an array! haha <br>
        The ternary operator is one of my favorite things about JavaScript (and other languages that use it). <br>
        Most of the chapter felt like a review. Although I did learn some interesting stuff. 
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
    <p>
        The author mentions 3 ways to declare a function but does not talk about a fourth one, const myFunc = () => {} <br>
        I prefer arrow functions, they look kind of cleaner to me <br>
        Personally, I do not see the need of the rest operator...that could be solved using a for loop without overcomplicating <br>
        Oh, ok now the author is talking about arrow functions <br>
        I have always thought that hoisting is one of the biggest advantages of JavaScript. <br>
        I did not know variables could use this as well. It is interesting that they use "var" for this. But I must agree, it is confusing. <br>
        Basically, a callback is calling a function inside another function. <br>
        The chapter again felt like a review, but I am not complaining about it, I loved reading this book! I will now read Eloquent Javascript and see what I can find over there.
