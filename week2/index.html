   <h1>Week 02: Notes</h1>
   <h2>Chapter 2: Javascript Novice to Ninja</h2>
   <p>Most of it felt just like a review. I loved reviewing this part of Javascript but I do not feel like it was necessary <br>
       <br>
       What was interesting is knowing more about the world "var" I never understood why it remained in the language, but now I know why <br>
       I loved learning that this happened because Javascript is always attempting to remain compatible to previous versions <br> <br>
       <i> "A ninja programmer will try to keep thenumber of global variables to a minimum,"</i> That made me laugh <br> <br>
       "If let or const are not used, the variable will have global scope and be available outside the block" That is some new information <br>
       I did not know that that is how you declare a global variable... I always use the "use strict" to avoid falling into some issues <br>
       So the fact that this is what a global scope is, is just mindblowing <br> <br>
       The fact that a variable can begin with a dollar sign or an underscore makes me wonder "do I really know JavaScript at all"? <br>
    <br> I wonder, are the bitwise operators being used at all? I have not seen anyone using them. Maybe my question should be "When and why should I use them?" <br>
    <br>
